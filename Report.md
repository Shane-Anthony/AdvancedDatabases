## Background

The goal of this project is to develop a PHP/MySQL application that extends the given EMP and DEPT schema with three new tables of our own design, implement the database, and populate it with relevant data. In addition, we need to implement a PHP page that connects to the database in the backend, allows for updating tables (adding a new employee or department), and executing and displaying the results of three SQL queries. The second part of the project involves migrating the database to a MongoDB document database using denormalization techniques and updating the PHP application. The third part requires drawing conclusions from working with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

## Tasks

In this task section, it is worth mentioning that our team consisted of Shane and Michael, who collaborated to complete the project. For task 1, Shane worked on the front end, while Michael worked on the back end. For task 2 Shane worked on both back end and front end.

It is also worth noting that our team decided to work together on the report and video aspects of the project. By collaborating, we were able to leverage each other's strengths and skills to deliver a high-quality project in a timely manner.

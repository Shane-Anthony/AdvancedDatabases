## Background

The goal of this project is to develop a PHP/MySQL application that extends the given EMP and DEPT schema with three new tables of our own design, implement the database, and populate it with relevant data. In addition, we need to implement a PHP page that connects to the database in the backend, allows for updating tables (adding a new employee or department), and executing and displaying the results of three SQL queries. The second part of the project involves migrating the database to a MongoDB document database using denormalization techniques and updating the PHP application. The third part requires drawing conclusions from working with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
